# [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)

This repository contains my attempts at solving the challenges of [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) using PHP.
Why PHP? Why not? Some aspects of the language work good for these challenges, others don't üòÅ.

I'm in the Europe/Amsterdam timezone, which means puzzles release when I should be sleeping.
Therefore, I don't compete for speed, just for fun!

I tend to write a bunch of assertions to catch unexpected cases, and often favor writing it more fancy than strictly required.
